## Course Overview
Welcome to the Control Systems Design course, an introduction to the principles and methods that form the foundation of modern control engineering. This course is tailored for undergraduate students, focusing on single-inputâ€“single-output (SISO) systems and bridging the gap between theory and practical application.

**What You Will Learn:** 
In this course, you will explore the essential techniques required to model, analyze, and design control systems. By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of how to create effective and robust control solutions for a variety of dynamic systems, from mechanical and electrical systems to real-world examples like quadrotor drones.

**Course Highlights:** 
* Dynamic System Modeling: Learn how to derive mathematical models for mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical systems.
* System Analysis: Gain insights into system behavior using Laplace transforms, transfer functions, poles and zeros, and stability criteria.
* Feedback Control: Understand the principles of feedback, including its impact on disturbance rejection, tracking accuracy, and dynamic response.
* Advanced Control Techniques: Master key design methods such as root locus, frequency response, and state-space approaches for control systems.

**Why This Course Matters:** 
Control systems are at the heart of modern technology, powering everything from industrial automation and robotics to aerospace systems and automotive design. Through this course, you will acquire the tools and skills to tackle real-world engineering challenges and contribute to innovative solutions in a variety of industries.

**Prerequisites:** EE207
