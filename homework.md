# Homework
Homework submission will be through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/955242). Inform the instructor if you have not been added to the course.

**Read** about how to submit assignments on Gradescope [here](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#variable_length_submissions). Some pointers:
* Make sure your written work is clear and easy to read. If the TA cannot read your work, he cannot grade it. He may ask you to resubmit, or take points off.
* Do upload high quality PDF scans; most modern smartphones have a document scanning functionality.
* Make sure to use the tools in Gradescope to mark where in your upload the answer to each question can be found.
* One good practice is to start each question on a new page.
* For a multi-page answer, associate all relevant pages with the question.
* You are encouraged to typeset the homework in LaTeX. The best way to get started with LaTeX is to make a free account at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and start with one of the free templates available. Their [tutorial section](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials) is very helpful.

Revise the [Homework Policy]({{site.baseurl}}/hwpolicy/) section for more details on the policies.
